## Rachel's Movie Recommendations

This repository is to track the movies that we feel Rachel should watch.

Please keep in mind that we are trying to limit this repository to items that
we think Rachel would enjoy, not films that we think are good. Example, if you
enjoy horror movies, the horror movie may be fantastic, but it is not
something that Rachel would watch.

PRs to add movies and comments are welcome.
